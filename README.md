# NSK Warrior

Using [**EmulatorJS**](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/) to preserve an original game created with RPG Maker (PSX).

## Introduction
**NSK Warrior** is a comical, survival-horror game about an aspiring janitor working at a grimiy factory.  Originally developed using RPG Maker for the PlayStation (PSX), the game was difficult to share.  Thanks to [**EmulatorJS**](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/), this project brings the experience to the web, making it accessible to all.

## Usage
To play the game, simply open your web browser and navigate to [nsk-warrior.netlify.app](https://nsk-warrior.netlify.app). Install the PWA to your home screen for a more integrated experience.

The game is also available at [itch.io](https://imaginary-monkey.itch.io/nsk-warrior).

## Features
- **Playable in Browser:** Enjoy the game directly in your web browser.
- **PWA Support:** Install as a Progressive Web App for a native app-like experience.
- **Original Game Booklet** While playing, flip through maps and game details in the original booklet that accompanied the game.
- **Autosave & Resume:** Your progress is automatically saved when navigating back or when the app window is hidden. Play resumes automatically on reload.
