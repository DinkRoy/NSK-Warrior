## Introduction
**NSK Warrior** is a comical, survival-horror game about an aspiring janitor working at a grimy factory.  

Since it was originally developed using RPG Maker for the PlayStation (PSX), the game was incredibly difficult to share. 

Thanks to [**EmulatorJS**](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/), this project brings the experience to the web, making it easily accessible.

## Usage
To play the game, simply open your web browser and navigate to [nsk-warrior.netlify.app](https://nsk-warrior.netlify.app). Install the PWA to your home screen for a more integrated experience.

The game is also available at [itch.io](https://imaginary-monkey.itch.io/nsk-warrior).

## Features
- **Playable in Browser:**  Enjoy the game directly in your web browser.
  
- **PWA Support:**  Install as a Progressive Web App for a native app-like experience.
  
- **Original Game Booklet:**  While playing, flip through maps and game details in the original booklet that accompanied the game.
